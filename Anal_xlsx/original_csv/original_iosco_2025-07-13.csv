Lquid Pay has claimed on social media that:

it is fully compliant with New Zealand’s laws, and
it holds a registered New Zealand trademark. 
The FMA requested Lquid Pay to provide explanation and evidence to substantiate their claims above. Lquid Pay has failed to provide a response to our request. We therefore suspect that claims made are false and misleading.

Making false and misleading statements, particularly information relating to compliance in any jurisdiction(s), like those made by Lquid Pay mentioned above, is a common technique used by scam operations to create an air of legitimacy of their business.

Lquid Pay is not authorised to provide financial services in New Zealand, and we do not believe it holds any New Zealand trademark.

Ashbourne Wealth Management posts advertisements on social media, encouraging victims to invest.
The victim’s small initial investment quickly grows to large profits.
Ashbourne Wealth Management tells the victim they will need to pay a large upfront fee to withdraw their profits.
When the victim is unable or unwilling to pay, Ashbourne Wealth Management offers to pay the fees for the victim.
The victim receives funds into their bank account from a third party who is the victim of a recovery room scam.
The victim is then instructed to forward the funds received to Ashbourne Wealth Management to pay for the withdrawal fees.
The victim has unknowingly become a money mule for Ashbourne Wealth Management.
We recommend caution when dealing with any person or entity that operates the same or similar ways described above. If a person or entity asks you to receive funds and instructs you to pay them on to a third party, exercise extreme caution. These are warning signs that the entity may be operating a money mule scam.

Bit Pro Gain says it is offering an online trading platform but is operating an investment scam. 

We have received a report from a New Zealand investor who created an account with Bit Pro Gain through the website bitprogain.io, and began with a small credit card payment to the platform. The investor says that Bit Pro Gain then took several unauthorised payments from the investor’s bank account, totalling more than $250,000. 

Scam uses remote access software to access financial information. When an investor creates a new account with Bit Pro Gain, they are prompted to install an app on their phone. Users are told the app will let them receive notifications about their investments. However, the app is a remote access application, which can grant Bit Pro Gain access to notifications and messages from the user’s phone and other devices. Bit Pro Gain may be able to use this access to receive users’ banking information or 2 factor authentication codes.

Bit Pro Gain is operating through multiple websites. We have concerns that bitpro-gain.com may be associated with the same investment scam, as the website offers similar services to bitprogain.io and uses the name Bit Pro-Gain. The website also displays a doctored version of a New Zealand Certificate of Incorporation.

They contact previous scam victims and offer assistance to recover money they have lost to scams;

The Individual claimed he could help recover money lost to a previous investment.  

Fabricated documents were supplied to help convince the victim of this individual’s identity and ability to access lost funds. In order to recover this money, the victim was required to pay a contract fee over a period of months.  

The victim was also instructed to install the remote access software “anydesk” as part of this process.  

This has resulted in the victim losing a significant amount of money, as the software gave the scammer access to different passwords.  

We have contacted the owners of the BTCSWE cryptocurrency exchange, who confirm they have been impersonated as part of a wider “recovery scam”.

Complainants have been communicating with the fake licensees on the messaging app Telegram.

 

Here are some ways you can verify the authenticity of a licence certificate holder: 

All Financial Service Providers (FSP) and FMA licence holders are listed on the FSP Register, you can check registration details here. Make sure the FSP number, name of entity/licence holder, and the registered/licensed service type match the information printed on any certificate provided.  
Most FSP and licence holders are New Zealand-registered companies. Some companies have their contact details or website address displayed on the Companies Register. You can also contact the company/licence holder to verify the licence with them, but DO NOT use telephone or email details given to you by the person showing you the licence certificate. You may simply be directed to an accomplice.
If the company or licence holder’s contact details are not shown on the Companies Register, search for their website on the internet. New Zealand company websites usually end with .co.nz but could have other domain names. 
We encourage anyone reading this warning to share it with friends and whānau, including on social media platforms to help protect others from harm.
